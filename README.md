# A QuickCopy Template for Export Zotero Items to Markdown Files

Here I provided an [ETA](https://eta.js.org/) template for [better bibtex](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex) users 
to drag-and-drop [Zotero](https://github.com/zotero/zotero) items into Markdown files like:

> [Author, Year](zotero_link)

So that you could use BBT's QuickCopy function to export easy-reading links in markdown files that associate the author-year label with corresponding Zotero item.

What may look confusing is that this template exported both the lastName and the name of creator while replacing all "undefined". 
This manipulation allows Asian names (like Chinese names) could be exported as a whole to meet the academic customs of these nations,
especially after the batch modification of [jasminum](https://github.com/l0o0/jasminum)https://github.com/l0o0/jasminum.

Hope this little template accelerates your note-taking experience when reading papers :)
